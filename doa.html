    <h1>DOA (Dead on Arrival) Policy</h1>
    <p>We take the health and wellbeing of our fish seriously and always do our best to make sure they arrive safe, healthy, and happy. All fish are fasted before travel, double-bagged with pure oxygen, and packed securely in insulated boxes with heat or cold packs as needed.</p>

    <h2>Local Deliveries (Within Our Delivery Radius)</h2>
    <p>If you're local, we’ll personally deliver your fish in a face-to-face handover, carefully coordinated with you to make sure someone is home to receive them. This is the safest option for your fish, and we’re proud to say DOAs are extremely rare with this method.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event that something does go wrong, we’ll offer a free replacement or refund—just send us a clear photo of the fish in their bag within 1 hour of receiving them.</p>

    <h2>Courier Deliveries (Outside Our Local Radius)</h2>
    <p>For those a bit further away, we use reliable overnight couriers who are experienced with live fish transport. We pack each order with the same care and attention, but once it leaves us, the courier journey is out of our hands.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Please provide clear, timestamped photos of the fish still sealed in the bag within 1 hour of delivery.</li>
      <li>We’ll do our best to offer a refund or store credit, minus the delivery cost.</li>
      <li>Please make sure someone is home to receive the delivery, and double-check that your address details are correct—courier delays or missed deliveries due to address errors can’t be covered.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’ve got any questions or want to check if you’re within our local delivery area, feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. We’re always happy to help!</p>
